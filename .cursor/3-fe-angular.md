# Frontend conventions

## Component architecture

- Standalone components only. No `NgModule` files — no exceptions.
- File naming: `kebab-case.component.{ts,html,scss}`. Each component gets its own directory under `src/app/features/<name>/`.
- When adding a new route, three files change together in one session: the component itself, `app.routes.ts` (lazy `loadComponent`), and the nav link in `app.component.html`. Partial wiring leaves a broken nav or a 404.

## View-state pattern — the only allowed async pattern

- `shared/view-state.ts` defines `ViewState<T>` — a discriminated union of `idle | loading | data | error`. Every feature component that makes an API call holds `signal<ViewState<T>>(idle())`.
- Initialise with `idle()` when the component has a trigger (button click, form submit). Initialise with `loading()` and fire immediately in `ngOnInit` when the data loads automatically.
- The template must render all four states explicitly. No flash of empty UI, no silent null.
- `calculator`, `historical`, and `analytics` components follow this pattern — check any of them for the canonical shape.

## API calls

- `core/services/api.service.ts` is the only file that calls `HttpClient`. Components call `ApiService` methods only.
- Every method in `ApiService` ends with `catchError(this.normaliseError)`. The `normaliseError` private method maps any `HttpErrorResponse` to a `ProblemDetail`-shaped error object — components never inspect raw `HttpErrorResponse`.
- API base URL comes from `AppConfigService` / `environment.ts`. Never hard-code `localhost:8080` in a component or service.
- Typed response models live in `core/models/exchange.models.ts`. Add new response shapes there — no inline interfaces in component files.

## Forms

- Reactive forms (`FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`) for any form with more than one field. Template-driven only if the form is a single field with no cross-field validation.
- Built-in validators (`Validators.required`, `Validators.pattern`) first. Custom validators only when the built-ins can't express the constraint.
- Cross-field validation (e.g. `toDate` must not be before `fromDate`) goes in the component class, not in a shared validator, unless the same rule is reused in two or more forms.

## Styles

- SCSS scoped per component (Angular's default `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated`). No bleeding styles.
- Global resets and theme variables only in `styles.scss`. Do not add component-specific rules there.

## TypeScript

- `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`. Never introduce `any` — use `unknown` with a type guard if the shape is genuinely variable.
- Signals for local component state (`signal<T>()`), not `BehaviorSubject` or class fields with `markForCheck`.

## Charts

- Charts via `ng2-charts` (Chart.js wrapper). Keep `ChartData` and options in the component file where the chart lives — no shared chart-config module.
- `historical` uses a line chart; `analytics` uses a bar chart.
